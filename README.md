# Word-Cloud-Generator-using-Python

Generating a word cloud from a text file that contains phrases related to AI and ML. A word cloud is an image made of words that together resemble a cloudy shape. The size of a word shows how important it is e.g. how often it appears in a text â€” its frequency. People typically use word clouds to easily produce a summary of large documents (reports, speeches), to create art on a topic (gifts, displays) or to visualise data (tables, surveys).
